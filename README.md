## Overview
These notes are an IBL task sequence for an introduction to proof course. The task-sequence was written by [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (Northern Arizona University), but the first half of the notes are an adaptation of notes written by [Stan Yoshinobu](http://www.calpoly.edu/~styoshin/) (Cal Poly) and [Matthew Jones](http://www.csudh.edu/math/mjones/) (California State University, Dominguez Hills). Any errors in the notes are no one's fault but my own. In this vein, if you think you see an error, please [inform me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu), so that it can be remedied.
